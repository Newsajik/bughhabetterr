                Welcome to the Unblocked Web!
            </h1>
            <p>
                Were you not happy because your adminstrator blocks the websites that you had fun with?
                <br>
                Well, there is one option that you could make, it is going here to browse the web!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                To get started, type in the website address here:
            </p>
            <input type="text" placeholder="Type your URL here..." value="https://example.com" id="address">
            <br>
            <br>
            <button id="browse">
                Redirect without any blockage.
            </button>
            <br>
            <br>
            <button id="googleSearch">
                Redirect to Google (Safe version)
            </button>
            <br>
            <br>
            <small>
                There's actually a hint though to find the easter egg, type in https://fall-season.com!
            </small>
            <script>
                document.querySelector("#googleSearch").addEventListener("click", () => {
                    let input = document.querySelector("#address");
                    input.value = "https://www.google.com/?igu=1";
                    setTimeout(() => {
                        let browseBtn = document.querySelector("#browse");
                        browseBtn.click();
                    }, 500);
                });
            </script>

                Tutorial for new people on the website!
            </h2>
            <p>
                In this page, copy a web address, or type it in on your own.
                <br>
                Then press Redirect. Now when you press it, it will take you to <i>"website.html"</i>, with the url with the hash from the page.
                <br>
                Since you went to your first website here, you would see a image of this website's logo. This <b><i>"image"</i></b> is actually a button, and when you click on it, it shows you options on what to do.
                <br>
                In the options panel, you would find: A redirect input, so that way you won't have to go back and forth. A homepage button, which sends you to the homepage of this website. A Open in New Tab button, which sends you to the website in a new tab. Finally, a Fullscreen button.
            </p>
